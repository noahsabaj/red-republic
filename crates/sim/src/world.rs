//! The world: all simulation state, and the tick that advances it.
//!
//! # Determinism rules that live here
//!
//! Two constraints bind anything added to [`World`], and both are easy to
//! violate by accident:
//!
//! 1. **No `HashMap` or `HashSet` in simulation state.** Their iteration order
//!    is randomised per process, so a system that walks one produces a
//!    different order every run and the world diverges. Use `Vec` or
//!    `BTreeMap`. This is the single most likely way determinism gets lost.
//! 2. **No wall-clock, no thread-local, no address-dependent behaviour.** The
//!    only clock is [`SimClock`] and the only randomness is [`Rng`].
//!
//! # Saves
//!
//! [`World`] derives its serialization rather than hand-writing it, on purpose.
//! The archived build's save round-trip test existed to catch fields someone
//! forgot to add to `serialize()`; a derive removes that whole class of bug
//! instead of testing for it. What the round-trip test still earns is proof
//! that reloading resumes the *same future*, which no derive can give you.
